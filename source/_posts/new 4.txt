Hi John!

It is quite unusual to write a letter on paper, I have already forgotten how to do it.

I've found your address on the map, looks like you are living in a forest, quite far from Choudrant itself. On the Google Panorama the town seems neat and quiet. I have to notice the roads are very good, I haven't seen a crack or a pothole. USA is famous by its roads and highway system. Here in Russia roads are still far from ideal, though they became better in the last decade. I saw many pickup trucks near the houses, it is so American!

On weekend we've been to the plot again, for the first time on the new car. There is too much snow this year, it is almost impossible to walk through the plot. We measured the rooms in the house once again to have a precise measurement for further designing. In the first days of May we are going to start the construction again. Now I am using SketchUp to design and engineer the house.
